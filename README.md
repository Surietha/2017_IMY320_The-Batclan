Proposal structure overview 
This proposal is structured using a combination of references these include the academic proposal guide by the University of Toronto ( Procter, 2017) which provide the headings rationale and outline. Other headings and subheading are gathered from, The Alley Blog ( Paradis, 2015). Here I use the structure that a company uses when requesting a proposal to create the scheme. Headings used are the introduction, Website Objectives and Website Functionality Requirements. Other heading are not used as they are concerned with finances or about the old website a company has. Finally the wireframe and visual design/illustrations headings are from (raramuridesign, 2017) , Phases of the Web Development Process.


Introduction
In this assignment we were asked to develop an interactive website that revolves around the user experience. The websites theme being the game developed in IMY 300.

About the game
The game is a first person horror game named; My name is Shadow. 
The ultimate goal of the game is to shut down the compound you are in and lock the final door. In order to lock this door you need to collect 4 keys. You are being chased by a monster that can only harm you if you are in the dark therefore you must stay in the light. There are different types of lights each with their own functions and the player must use these functions to their advantage.

Approach
My attended approach to this project is to create a site that is quite dark where the user has to use the mouse pointer as a “light” as they move the mouse around they will see and encounter new elements that they can interact with. Clicking on certain objects or text will cause a light to “turn on” showing them related information. For instance clicking image of the monster will cause a paragraph or two of information to appear somewhere nearby that the user can see and read. 
 

Rationale
The reason this design  is chosen is  because it ties in the core mechanic of the game, that being the need to stay in the light, in this version you stay in the light to see the information, this gives the user the first general sense of the game. It also connects with the mood and feel of the game.

Website Objectives
The objective of this site is to provide information on the game but this need to be in a way that is interactive which is to “respond to actions or involves frequent user participation “ (Merriam-Webster, n.d.).It must also show off some of the trends in seen in website development.

The trends in specific that I would like to use are: 
1.	A “move to the dark” color definition that uses darker colors of black’s and greys with splashes of red. The reason behind this stems from the fact that the game is horror game and darker colors set a frame of mind that is more connected with negative anxious moods ( Pappas, 2010)Each color also has different meanings Gray for its connotation to grief, black for the fear and evil connections and red for aggression and violence ( Olesen, n.d.).
2.	Asymmetry: this will be used in the layout for it’s unbalanced, disorder it also creates a mood that can be unsettling. (Kole, 2010). This again connects to the horror theme.
3.	Chaos: This will be seen in the layout of elements as they will be scattered around with no clear connection to their places on the webpage again links with the unbalanced tension and will lead the user to explore and search more.
4.	Large typography:  this will be necessary for elements to stand out in the dark environment.
5.	One pager: Would like to use these due to the immersive feeling single pages ( Schneider, n.d.)give to user also so there is no disconnect from the “searching” feeling.  A big disadvantage of single pagers is that they are bad when it comes to large content sites ( Schneider, n.d.), this site will not hold much content making a single page more feasible. 
 

Outline
The content the website will hold will be:
o	The synthesis
o	A game play video
o	Introduction to the characters
o	About the creator
o	Creation details such as when it was created what it was created with etc
This content will be at random places on the website presented in various ways for instance pictures for the characters. When these items are clicked another small section will light up showing information related to this.

Timeline
•	20 August-Proposal and concept delivered
•	8 September- Prototype: This is 60%-80% of the final product
•	29 September- Final website and feedback
Website Functionality Requirements
The requirements in terms of functionality are as listed below:
o	The website must be a one page scrolling website
o	It must be dark except for the area around the cursor
o	The website must be able to host and play a video
o	Clicking on an interactive component will lead to a small section of related text appearing

Illustrations 

 
Figure 1: Above is an image showing the idea of what the website would look like, the cursor illuminating the ‘About’ that can be clicked with other type(creator) hidden in the dark to be found



 
Figure 2: This image is a basic idea of what will happen when you click on any of the interactive objects. Another light will turn on giving the user something to read.
